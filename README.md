This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Hello, welcome to my Knockri Assessment

## What does it do?
A simple React application, where users will be able to view a job candidate's video responses, comment on the responses & save the data.

In the project directory, you can run:

### Clone the project

### Run the backend api.json: `npm start`

### `npm install`

Install the dependencies in the local node_modules folder.

In global mode (ie, with -g or --global appended to the command), it installs the current package context (ie, the current working directory) as a global package.

By default, npm install will install all modules listed as dependencies in package.json.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Tech

* ReactJS - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* react-router-dom - For dynamic, client-side routing, allows us to build a single-page web application with navigation without the page refreshing as the user navigates. React Router uses component structure to call components, which display the appropriate information.
* node-sass - Sass is a stylesheet language thatâ€™s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. By using it I can keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.


### Questions


How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?

 - I used React.js, Sass, and react-router-dom. React was the basic requirement for this task. I used fetch() method when implementing the data from the given API. Fetch takes one mandatory argument, the path to the resource you want to fetch. It returns a Promise that resolves to the Response to that request, whether it is successful or not. Sass is always my go-to for styling because of the allowance of mixins, variables, and nested rules. Finally, router was manditory in order to create a SPA to call specific components to display appropriate info.

Are there any improvements you could make to your submission? 

 - With more time I could clean up the UI/UX to make it more inviting and easier to use. I would also like to create a section for the new comments to appear.

What would you do differently if you were allocated more time? 

 - I would have implemented Redux for easier state managment.
